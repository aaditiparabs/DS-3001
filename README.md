## A Little Bit About the Course

What is Data Science, why is it becoming so important and what is needed to be successful in this field? We will explore these questions throughout the course through a variety of topics with data always at the center.  In all things, we focus on creative thinking, not blind implementation. If you cannot answer why you are doing something, not only will you discover no new knowledge but you will also create new problems versus solving them.

The course centers on lab-based work and employs a team-based pedagogy, meaning much of the work in the course can and should be completed in collaboration with your classmates.  Though very applied, we also include theoretical content and will have discussion sessions depending on the topic for any given week.

I am also aware that students come from different backgrounds and have a variety of skill sets that they bring to the class.  There will be plenty of opportunities for those that would like to take advantage of extra discussions during office hours, TA support sessions, and team-based work that is designed in such a way that we can all learn from each other.   

Throughout the course, we will endeavor to “live the life of a data scientist” allowing you to not only be directly taught but gain a sense of what it would be like to be working as a data scientist.  You’ll be asked to discover new knowledge and share it with your peers and learn how to use the larger ecosystem of data science to your benefit.  

## What you’ll learn along the way

Data Science is incredibly broad and dynamic. The topics below are designed to reinforce this perspective and help you understand the field’s core tenements and what is demanded from practicing data scientists.  The key is for you to gain a sense of the scope of Data Science, what is needed to contribute to the community, and feel comfortable incorporating these techniques into your work moving forward. Specific learning objectives are below:
    
Learning Objectives:
* Gain experience working in teams to solve data driven problems
* Be able to describe the field of machine learning
* Understand computational and mathematical foundations of the methods presented
* Articulate the advantages and disadvantages of selected ML approaches
* Be able to select appropriate ML models given problems and data types
* Understand the importance of and methods for evaluating ML models
* Gain the foundational knowledge necessary to succeed in future machine learning coursework
    

The course will move rather quickly and can be demanding at times. However, you’ll be amazed how much you learn at the end of the semester!


## How You’ll Know You Are Learning

On any given week, the course will require reviewing short video lectures and completing readings prior to coming to class.  These lectures and readings will then be implemented in the lab portion of the course which will be conducted during the scheduled class period.  Lab sessions will include a variety of activities but mostly be centered on team-oriented coding assignments.  Students can also use lab sessions to work on mid-term and final projects when needed.

Grading Breakdown:
Quizzes (25%) – Each module will feature 1 or 2 short summary quizzes (5 in total). They will be
open-note and auto-graded by Canvas. You are allowed unlimited chances to complete the quiz and as
such, feedback for specific questions will be hidden. Quizzes should be completed individually.

Labs (50%) – We will have 4 in-class lab assignments throughout the class. Labs are designed to allow
you to practice the skills being presented in class. While they will be submitted individually, you are
encouraged to work with your peers to the best of your interest. Labs will be submitted on Canvas and
while individual submission requirements will differ for each week, you will typically need to submit:
  * A publishable markdown or Python notebook document in PDF or HTML format
  * Raw code folder (.zip) or link (ie: GitHub)

Final Presentation and Report (25%) – The course will culminate in a final project that will involve
working with a dataset of your choice, giving a presentation, and submitting well-annotated code to
include summary information in report form. This is an open-ended project designed to allow small
groups and individuals to choose a topic of personal interest from the semester and perform exploratory
data analysis (EDA) and predictive modelling on. The project will have intermediary assignments
embedded within lab sessions. Graded deliverables will be released alongside an evaluation rubric.

  * Data Description (Pass/Fail) - 1 page description of group member(s), dataset source, size,
  features, and potential considerations when processing or cleaning data.
  * Pre-Analysis Plan (Pass/Fail) - 2 page summary of the intended data features and model plan.
  Plans should include at least 2 EDA visualizations and 2 supervised learning components.
  * Final Presentation (10%) - Groups will give 15 minute presentations of their findings and
  analysis. Presentations should include an overview of the dataset, key methods and results, and a
  discussion of the implications of results.
  * Final Report (15%) - 5 page collaborative report and code due after presentation during the
  Finals period. The report will include a description of data preparation, substantial interpretation
  of results, and discussion of analysis with its ethical implications.
      
## Tech Stack

    VS Code/Google Collab/Rivana - You'll need to have the software loaded and ready to go day one, but we will help if needed. 
    Miniconda/Conda - [Mini-Recommended](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
    Github - Almost all course materials (will post on Canvas as needed)
    Canvas - Submission of assignments and class-wide communications
    Docker - Virtual machines 
    Discord - Low latency comms for groups and class.
